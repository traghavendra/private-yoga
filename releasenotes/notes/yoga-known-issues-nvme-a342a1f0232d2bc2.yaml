    **NVMe-oF issues**

    Cinder and Nova use the os-brick library to facilitate connections
    to volumes.  The ``nvmeof`` os-brick connector has been refactored
    over the past few development cycles.  In between the time of the
    Yoga os-brick release (os-brick 5.2.0) and this cinder release,
    several bugs were discovered in this connector.  You can find these
    in the bug tracker with this query:
