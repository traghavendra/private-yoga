    Just before release, `Bug #1965847
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1965847>`_ was reported.
    When importing a backup record for a backup_id that currently
    exists, the import fails as expected.  However, this operation
    has the unfortunate side effect that the existing backup record
    is deleted.  Initial analysis of the bug indicates a small,
    isolated solution that should be backportable to stable branches.

    When the Ceph backup driver is used for the backup service,
    restoring a backup to a volume created on a non-RBD backend fails.
    The cinder team has developed a fix but decided to do more thorough
    testing before including it in a release.  When ready, the solution
    is expected to be backported to a future release in the Yoga series.
    The issue is being tracked as `Bug #1895035
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1895035>`_.

    Creating a volume of an encrypted volume type from an image in
    the Image service (Glance) using the generic NFS driver results
    in an unusable volume.  The cinder team is working on a solution
    which is expected to be backported to a future release in the
    Yoga series.  The issue is being tracked as `Bug #1888680
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1888680>`_.

    **Cinder use of cgroups v1**

    This note applies to deployments that are using the cinder
    configuration option ``volume_copy_bps_limit`` in its non-default
    value (the default is 0).

    The cinder-volume service depends on `Linux Kernel Control Groups
    (cgroups) version 1
    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/cgroups.html>`_
    to control i/o throttling during some volume-copy and image-convert
    operations.  Some Linux distributions, however, have changed to using
    `cgroup v2
    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html>`_
    by default and may have discontinued cgroups v1 support completely.
    Consult your Linux distribution's documentation for details.

    The cinder team is working on a throttling solution using cgroup
    v2, but it was not ready at the time of this release.  The solution
    is expected to be backported to a future release in the Yoga series.
    This issue continues to be tracked as `Bug #1942203
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1942203>`_.
